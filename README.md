# machine-oriented-programming_exercises
I will use this Project for the exercises of the course "Maschinennahe Programmierung". This will mostly be ColdFire-Architecture Assembler code.
The IDE used to build this project is CodeWarrior Development Studio 11.0

The Tasks of the Exercises can be found in "Praktikumsanleitung.pdf"
My Solutions can be found in Source/ex<exercise_numer>_main.c
