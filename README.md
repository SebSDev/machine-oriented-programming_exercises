# machine-oriented-programming_exercises
I will use this Project for the exercises of the course "Maschinennahe Programmierung". This will mostly be ColdFire-Architecture Assembler code.<br/>
The IDE used to build this project is CodeWarrior Development Studio 11.0

The Tasks of the Exercises can be found in `Praktikumsanleitung.pdf`.<br/>
My Solutions can be found in `Source/main.c`. Each exercise has its own function (i.e. Exercise07 is the Function `exSeven()`) <br/>
